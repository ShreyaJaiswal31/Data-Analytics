# Data-Analytics

## Overview

The Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience simulates the real responsibilities of a data analyst in a commercial analytics team. Over approximately **4–5 hours** of tasks, the simulation builds practical skills in data preparation, exploratory analysis, experimentation evaluation, statistical testing, and synthesizing insights into a professional report for stakeholders.

Skills demonstrated in this project include:

- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization  
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing  
- Commercial thinking and insight communication

## Tasks Summary

### Task 1: Data Preparation & Customer Analytics

In this task, I analyzed transactional and customer demographic datasets to identify purchasing behavior trends and derive insights that would inform the supermarket’s strategic plan for the product category.

**Activities included:**

- Cleaning and validating raw transaction and customer data  
- Deriving new features (e.g., product size, brand indicators)  
- Segmenting customers based on demographic and purchasing traits  
- Generating summary metrics to understand sales distribution  
- Creating visualizations to support insights  
- Preparing strategic recommendations for the client

### Task 2: Experimentation & Uplift Testing

The second task focused on evaluating the impact of store layout changes on store performance using controlled experimentation techniques.

**Core steps:**

- Identifying trial stores and potential control stores  
- Computing metrics (sales revenue, customer counts, transaction averages)  
- Applying similarity measures (e.g., Pearson correlation, magnitude distance) to select control stores  
- Performing comparison analysis to assess whether performance differences were statistically significant  
- Interpreting results in a business context

### Task 3: Analytics & Commercial Application

The final task brought together insights from Tasks 1 and 2 into a consolidated report for the category manager.

**Deliverables:**

- A structured report leveraging the Pyramid Principle framework  
- Data visualizations integrated into the narrative  
- Clear business context, insights, and tactical recommendations  
- Executive summary designed for non-technical stakeholders
